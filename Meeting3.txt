1.   Discussed on how to trim the data set.
 
We distributed the data based on number of steps. Corresponding to a range of steps we have number of students allotted. Meaning if we have a step range of 0-1000, we are allotting number of students that have/tried to solve a problem in that many steps. We are then calculating what is the percentage of these students in the total student population.
 
2.   Feature Extraction:
 
We decided to extract features based on following:
 
Q.Id=(P.Id,S.Id)
Duration= Duration for Q.Id
Hints= Number of hints required for Q.Id
 
3.   Supervised:
 
SVM
8 fold cross validation for testing.
 
We discussed how to incorporate these methods into our model.
 
4.  Unsupervised:
 
Instance Based Algorithm
Clustering.
